## Abstract

Recent data about the structure and development of electricity grids are crucial
for effective decision-making regarding investment and aid, particularly in devel-
oping countries and regions affected by natural disasters. With the advancement of
deep learning models grids and infrastructure can be inferred from high-resolution
satellite images. We test the ability of object detection models to find distribution and
transmission towers in satellite images with increasingly deteriorating spatial reso-
lutions. We find that decreasing the image resolution negatively affects the modelâ€™s
performance on the test set and drops sharply at 50 cm/pixel. We furthermore find
that the larger size of transmission towers leads to greater detection capacity across
resolutions. We further find that the variance in the training data colors and the simi-
larities in colors between the training and test sets positively affect the out-of-sample
performances
