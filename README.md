## Summary

Accurate and current data about the structure of electricity grids are crucial for ef fective decision-making regarding funding and aid, particularly in developing coun tries and regions affected by natural disasters. Deep learning models are capable of analyzing highly complex data such as image data for object detection. Object detection architectures such as Detectron2 can be used on a variety of tasks, includ ing infrastructure, such as electricity towers, from high-resolution satellite images. However, it remains unclear to what extent image resolution affects the performance of an energy tower detection model. Therefore, in this work, we test an object detection models’ ability to find distribution and transmission towers in satellite images with decreasing resolutions, the effect of changing training set com positions and varying tower sizes. We generally observe that the networks’ precision deteriorates as we gradually decrease the resolution. Further, training data that covers a broad spectrum of biotopes and that includes the target natural environment, enhances performance on the testing data and can not generalise out-of-sample. Diverse training sets also improve the otherwise poor out-of sample performance as well as performance in-sample when creating composite datasets. Finally, larger towers are more resilient to a decrease in resolution.
